## Old Performance Hooks (Before React 19)

Before React 19, React did not automatically optimize performance.
Every time a component re-rendered, all values and functions were recreated.

This could make applications slower.

To fix this, React introduced special hooks to help developers control
when things should update.

The most common performance hooks were:

- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`

---

## useMemo

`useMemo` is used to remember a **value**.

### What does it do?

- It saves the result of a calculation
- It prevents the calculation from running again on every render

React will only recalculate the value when something changes.

### Why was it needed?

Some calculations are slow.
If React recalculates them every time, the app becomes slower.

`useMemo` helps avoid this problem.

### Example

```jsx
const total = useMemo(() => {
  return calculateTotal(items);
}, [items]);
```

In this example:

- `calculateTotal` is only called again when items changes
- If items stays the same, React reuses the old value

## useCallback

`useCallback` is used to remember a **function**.

### What does it do?

- Stores a function between renders
- Keeps the same function reference
- Helps avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Why was it needed?

In React, functions are recreated on every render.

When a function is passed to a child component,
React thinks it is a new function every time.

This can cause child components to re-render even when nothing changed.

`useCallback` helps keep the function stable.

### Example

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Button clicked");
}, []);
```

### Explanation

- The `handleClick` function is created only once
- The same function is reused on every render
- Child components receive the same function reference

## React 19 Compiler

The React 19 Compiler is a new tool that automatically optimizes your code.

It works at **build time**, not at runtime.
This means your code is analyzed before it runs in the browser.

The compiler understands:

- which values are expensive to calculate
- which functions are stable
- when re-renders are really needed

---

## What does the compiler add?

The compiler adds **automatic optimizations** to your code.

You do not see these changes in your source files.
They are applied internally during compilation.

The compiler can:

- memoize values automatically
- keep functions stable
- reduce unnecessary re-renders
- make components faster by default

---

## What changes for developers?

With the React Compiler, you can write simpler code.

You no longer need to think about performance all the time.

Instead of writing:

```jsx
const value = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(data), [data]);
```

You can write:

```jsx
const value = heavyCalculation(data);
```

The compiler will optimize it for you when it is safe.

###Important to know

- `useMemo` and `useCallback` still exist
- They are not removed
- They are still useful in advanced or special cases

But for most applications:

- less manual optimization is needed
- code is easier to read
- performance is handled automatically
